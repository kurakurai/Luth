Building a French Small Language Model

## Quick Setup

_Using [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast and reliable dependency management._

```bash
# Basic environment setup
make env
```
That's it, you can now run any command you want!

⚠️ You might need to perform the following two steps manually before running `make env`:
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
source $HOME/.local/bin/env
```
